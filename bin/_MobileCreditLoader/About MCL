DISCLAIMER: The software program is a stand-alone or just a ‘dummy’ program
demonstrating the idea of an alternative network carrier services, and that every
operations and events occurring in this program version does not scope local or
wide network connections, neither real transactions nor the service subscriptions.
Also, it is not in our intention to collect information for those mentioned standards
according to the service protocol of the original system and these are all for the
functionality of the software project. Those information are just stored and used
for that purpose and not for other personal interests and illegal activities.
